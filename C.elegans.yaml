          Subject: Gene-to-Neuron Layer Integration Proposal
          
          Hi OpenWorm team,
          
          I'm an independent researcher interested in adding a gene→neuron 
          layer to the OpenWorm simulation. I've identified this as a missing 
          piece in the current pipeline.
          
          My approach: Use CeNGEN data to build neuron models from gene 
          expression rather than starting with neurons as given.
          
          Would love to discuss potential collaboration.
