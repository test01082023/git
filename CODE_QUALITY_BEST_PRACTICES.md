 # Code Quality and Best Practices

This document outlines the recommended code quality standards and best practices for all software projects. Adherence to these guidelines ensures code robustness, maintainability, and security.

## 1. Coding Standards

-   **Readability:** Write clear, concise, and self-explanatory code. Use meaningful variable and function names.
-   **Consistency:** Follow established style guides for the programming language used.
    -   **Python:** PEP 8 (use linters like `flake8` or `ruff`).
    -   **JavaScript/TypeScript:** ESLint, Prettier.
-   **Comments:** Add comments sparingly. Focus on explaining *why* a piece of code is complex or non-obvious, not *what* it does. Avoid redundant comments.
-   **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Avoid code duplication. Use functions, classes, or modules to abstract common logic.
-   **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):** Prefer simpler solutions over overly complex ones.

## 2. Testing

-   **Comprehensive Test Coverage:** Aim for high test coverage (e.g., >80%) for critical components.
-   **Types of Tests:**
    -   **Unit Tests:** Test individual functions or methods in isolation.
    -   **Integration Tests:** Test the interaction between different components or services.
    -   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Test the entire application flow from a user's perspective.
-   **Test Frameworks:** Use standard testing frameworks for the language (e.g., `pytest` for Python, Jest/Mocha for JavaScript).
-   **Testability:** Design code with testability in mind (e.g., dependency injection, avoiding global state).
-   **Automated Testing:** Integrate tests into CI/CD pipelines to run automatically on every commit or pull request.

## 3. Error Handling

-   **Graceful Failure:** Implement robust error handling to prevent unexpected crashes.
-   **Specific Exceptions:** Use specific exception types rather than generic `Exception` where possible.
-   **Logging:** Log errors with sufficient context (stack trace, relevant variables) to aid debugging.
-   **User Feedback:** Provide clear and user-friendly error messages.

## 4. Security

-   **Input Validation:** Always validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS, etc.).
-   **Secure Dependencies:** Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities. Use tools like `dependabot` or `snyk`.
-   **Secrets Management:** Never hardcode secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens). Use environment variables or dedicated secrets management solutions.
-   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run processes with the minimum necessary permissions. Avoid running as root whenever possible.
-   **Secure Communication:** Use HTTPS for all external communication. Encrypt sensitive data at rest.

## 5. Documentation

-   **Code Documentation:** Use docstrings for functions, classes, and modules to explain their purpose, parameters, and return values.
-   **README:** Maintain an up-to-date `README.md` with essential project information.
-   **API Documentation:** If building an API, generate documentation (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger) from code or specifications.

## 6. Version Control (Git)

-   **Commit Messages:** Use clear, concise, and descriptive commit messages. Follow a standard format (e.g., Conventional Commits: `feat: add user authentication`, `fix: resolve login bug`, `chore: update dependencies`).
    -   **Subject:** Imperative mood, max 50 chars.
    -   **Body (optional):** Explain the *why* and *how* of the change.
    -   **Footer (optional):** Breaking changes, issue references.
-   **Branching Strategy:** Use a consistent branching strategy (e.g., Gitflow, GitHub Flow).
-   **Code Reviews:** All code changes should undergo a code review process before merging.

## 7. Performance

-   **Efficient Algorithms:** Choose appropriate data structures and algorithms.
-   **Resource Management:** Release resources (e.g., file handles, network connections) promptly.
-   **Profiling:** Use profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks.

**Note:** These are general guidelines. Specific projects may have additional or more tailored requirements.
